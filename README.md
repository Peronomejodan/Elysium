# Elysium Private Server - Anathema (old core) & Elysium (Nost core - their current)
These branches are from the "NostReturns" leak (which is now removed.) The last actual timestamp as of the leak is Feb 15 2017, so this source is current as of that date (or near it.)

These cores are based off of MaNGOS/CMaNGOS, so I copied the license that they are licensed under (GNU 2+)

I created this repository in the event that the "maintainers" at Elysium don't post their source, we at least have something to work with and look at.

I'm currently working on an Ubuntu script that will automate the install process so that anyone using the distro can run the script and have their own server available (similar idea as the MaNGOS installer on their stable branch.)

If you plan to use PRs, please open a PR to the Nost-develop branch and I'll merge them in to master.
